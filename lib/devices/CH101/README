## application

### `app_config.h`

The `app_config.h` file is used for configuring and controlling the InvenSense CH101 and CH201 ultrasonic sensors in an application. It includes settings for:

- **Sensor Firmware Selection**: Choose the appropriate sensor firmware for the CH101 or CH201 models.
- **Sensor Configuration**: Define operational modes, maximum detection range, static target rejection, and receive pre-triggering settings.
- **Application Timing**: Specify the measurement interval for sensor data collection.
- **Data Handling**: Configure how amplitude and I/Q data are read and output, including options for blocking and non-blocking read modes.

These configurations allow for flexible adjustment to meet various measurement and data processing needs.
